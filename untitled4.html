The poor are often hit hardest by global heating. Forests provide food and medicines for indigenous peoples and many others. Many people’s livelihoods, especially in developing countries, depend on intact forest resources, and an abnormally large wildfire can be disastrous.</P>

Smoke from wildfires causes air pollution and is bad for your health no matter where you live. Wildfires release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere. Wildfires can cause displacement, stress and anguish to people who have to flee them, beyond those who suffer direct impacts.</p>
<p>
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported on 23 September 2019 that wild forest and peatland fires across Kalimantan and Sumatra, Indonesia, were putting nearly 10 million children at risk from air pollution. In many countries, escape and protection from air pollution is a privilege not everyone can afford or has equal access to. Air purifiers and good quality pollution masks can be expensive.

Women and girls, especially in developing countries, tend to be more at risk during disasters such as megafires. According to the United Nations Development Programme, the poor are likely to live under circumstances that make them less likely to survive and recover from a disaster event. Studies have shown that disaster fatality rates are much higher for women than for men.

Particulates and black carbon from forest fires are carried in the air and enter water courses. Researchers have quantified and characterized the black carbon flowing in the Amazon. “In aquatic ecosystems, effects of acidity, nitrogen, and mercury on organisms and biogeochemical processes are well documented.

Wildfires release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contribute to global heating when the size of the fire exceeds the CO2 reabsorption potential of re-growth. Wildfires on highly combustible peatland are particularly relevant for climate as they emit far more CO2 than ordinary forest or bush fires. These phenomena are known as climate feedback loops and increase the burden of emissions that must be reduced to limit global temperature increase.

While humans have used fire to manage landscapes for thousands of years, current wildfires, exacerbated by global heating and drought, are growing in scale and impact, destroying houses, infrastructure and wildlife—affecting biodiversity. They can cause economic decline, at least in the short term.

How wildfires start??
</font>
<br>
<font size="6" color="white">
 Though they are classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as natural disasters, only 10 to 15 percent of wildfires occur on their own in nature. The other 85 to 90 percent result from human causes, including unattended camp and debris fires, discarded cigarettes, and arson.

Factors affecting fire intensity:-
</center>
</font>
<font size="6" color="white"
<br>
-	Temperature
<br>
-	Wind
<br>
-	Stability of the atmosphere
<br>
-	Relative humidity
<br>
-	Precipitation
<br>
-	Cloud development
<br><br><br><br>
First:- temperature:-
<br>
<img src="https://www.auburn.edu/academic/forestry_wildlife/fire/images/015.jpg "   width="280" height="280" style="float: right">
-Air temperature has a direct influence on fire behavior because of the heat requirements for ignition and continuing the combustion process. Forest fuels receive heat by radiation from the sun.  As a result, less heat is required for ignition.  The differential heating of the earth’s surface is the driving force behind most of the influences on the atmosphere.  The sun emits short-wave energy rays (radiation).  When striking a solid object such as trees or grass, it is warmed.  The surface absorbs some of the heat and reflects some in long-wave radiation that is absorbed by the water vapor in the air thus raising its temperature as well.
<br><br><br><br>
second:- wind:-
<img src="https://www.interfire.org/features/wildfires/wildfire_treechar.JPG"   width="240" height="280" style="float: right">
<br>
-Wind has a strong effect on fire behavior due to the fanning effect on the fire.  Wind can change direction and intensity throughout the day.  This change can be very abrupt surprising the burner that is not alert.  Abrupt changes generally occur during the afternoon when atmospheric conditions are most unstable. Wind increases the supply of oxygen, which results in the fire burning more rapidly.

<br><br><br><br>

Third:- stability of the atmosphere:-
<img src="https://www.auburn.edu/academic/forestry_wildlife/fire/images/080.jpg"   width="330" height="340" style="float: right">
<br>
-Atmospheric stability is the resistance of the atmosphere to vertical motion.  If the atmosphere is unstable, vertical movement of air is encouraged and this tends to increase fire activity.  If the atmosphere is stable, vertical movement of air is discouraged and this decreases fire activity.  Parcels of air masses with different temperatures are continually mixing trying to reach the same temperature, much as boiling water.  The more difference in the temperatures in the atmosphere, the more unstable the conditions and the more movement--both vertical and horizontally.  More unstable conditions result in more vertical movement in the atmosphere.

<br><br><br><br>

Fourth:- RELATIVE HUMIDITY:-
<img src=""   width="340" height="380" style="float: right">
<br>
-Relative humidity is the term used in prescribed burning to express the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.  It is the ratio of actual water vapor in the atmosphere compared to the amount of water vapor that would saturate the atmosphere at that temperature.  When the relative humidity is 40 percent, it means that the atmosphere contains 40 percent of the moisture that it could contain at that same temperature.
<br><br>
-The lower the relative humidity, the more readily a fire will start and burn; the more vigorously a fire will burn.  As will be discussed in more detail later, moisture in the fuel absorbs heat and reduces the fires intensity before it is converted to steam and driven off.  When the relative humidity is low, the moisture in the fuel is readily evaporated as it rises to the surface of the fuel.  When the humidity is high, its harder for the moisture to evaporate into the air.  Consequently, high humidity acts like a damper on a stove.  If the humidity is 100 percent or close to it, the fuel will not dry.  On the other hand, the lower the relative humidity, the quicker the moisture will evaporate.
<br><br><br><br>

Fifth :-PRECIPITATION:-

<br>
-Precipitation (rain or snow) has a direct and immediate effect on fuel moisture and relative humidity.  Temperature usually drops as well and the winds become calm.  When the atmosphere becomes saturated, precipitation usually occurs if more moisture is added.  Precipitation will quickly dampen the surface of fuels to the point that fires cannot ignite and no wildfires will occur.
<br><br><br><br>

Sixth:- CLOUD DEVELOPMENT AND FRONTS:-
<br>
-When moisture is added to the atmosphere or the air temperature is lowered, the relative humidity increases.  When it increases to the saturation point, the moisture begins to combine into droplets.  As this process continues, the droplets become visible--as clouds.  When the atmosphere is very dry, saturation may not be reached, and  no clouds are formed.
<br><br>
<img src="https://windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/images/cloudformation_Fronts_small.jpg"   width="340" height="280" style="float: right">
-Clouds are formed when there is a lot of surface heating from the sun and a lot of moisture is present.  As the air close to the surface is heated, it rises to be replaced by cooler air.  The heated air can rise until it is saturated and clouds form.  As it rises the warmer air cools until it reaches the temperature of the surrounding air.  At this altitude puffy type cumulus clouds will form.  If they continue to build up, they become darker and rain may occur.

Wild fire effects
</center>
</font>
<br><br>
<font size="6" color="white">
<p>
1-Climate :- 

<img src="https://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/styles/icn_centered_medium/public/Black-Carbon-California-Wildfires-2018-529px.png?itok=DykCbH7K" width="200" height="210" style="float: right">
<br>
-Wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide, black carbon, brown carbon, and ozone precursors into the atmosphere. These emissions affect radiation, clouds, and climate on regional and even global scales.
</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>
2-Air Quality:-
<img src="https://powdersvillepost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Hazardous-air-quality-due-to-California-Oregon-wildfires-affects-kids-health.jpg"   width="240" height="250" style="float: right">
<br> -Wildfires also emit substantial amounts of volatile and semi-volatile organic materials and nitrogen oxides that form ozone and organic particulate matter. Direct emissions of toxic pollutants can affect first responders and local residents. In addition, the formation of other pollutants as the air is transported can lead to harmful exposures for populations in regions far away from the wildfires.
<br><br><br>
<img src="https://insideclimatenews.org/sites/default/files/styles/amp_full_width_600/public/California-Wildfires-Emissions-Chart.png?itok=Nzm-l2QS"   width="260" height="290" style="float: right">
-Fire suppression practices have led to a buildup of fuels in forests, a breakdown in natural forest ecology, and increased risk at urban-wildland boundaries. As a result, new policies now allow burning where possible.
<br><br>
-fires can directly and indirectly increase carbon emissions to the atmosphere. While they burn, fires release carbon stored in trees or in the soil. In some places like California or Alaska, additional carbon may be released as the dead trees decompose, a process that may take decades because dead trees will stand like ghosts in the forest, decaying slowly.
</p>
<br>
<p>
3-For people:-
<img src="https://psmag.com/.image/t_share/MTUxOTc5Mzg0MzI3MTIwMTYz/gettyimages-887230120.jpg"   width="200" height="190" style="float: right">
<br>
-beyond the immediate loss of life and property, smoke is a serious health hazard when small soot particles enter the lungs. Long-term exposure has been linked to higher rates of respiratory and heart problems. 
<br>
</p>
<br><br>
4-For animals :-
<img src="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/content/dam/news/photos/000/801/80133.ngsversion.1474545701286.adapt.1900.1.jpg"   width="200" height="190" style="float: right">
<br>
-when wildfire occurs, most animals sense it and can run away or stand in streams to avoid the hazard. Smaller animals take cover in logs, under rocks, or by burying themselves in the dirt. Some animal predators even capitalize on the fire, and have been observed hunting smaller animals who are fleeing the fire.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
5-Ash and smoke :-
<img src="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/734564/shutterstock_706065505.jpg"   width="200" height="190" style="float: right">
<br>
-Burning fires produce both ash, which falls to the ground like snow but can also get caught up in winds, and smoke, a mixture of gases and particulate matter. These get into the atmosphere and can travel long distances impacting air quality regionally.
