-Air temperature has a direct influence on fire behavior because of the heat requirements for ignition and continuing the combustion process. Forest fuels receive heat by radiation from the sun.  As a result, less heat is required for ignition.  The differential heating of the earth’s surface is the driving force behind most of the influences on the atmosphere.  The sun emits short-wave energy rays (radiation).  When striking a solid object such as trees or grass, it is warmed.  The surface absorbs some of the heat and reflects some in long-wave radiation that is absorbed by the water vapor in the air thus raising its temperature as well.

<br>
-Wind has a strong effect on fire behavior due to the fanning effect on the fire.  Wind can change direction and intensity throughout the day.  This change can be very abrupt surprising the burner that is not alert.  Abrupt changes generally occur during the afternoon when atmospheric conditions are most unstable. Wind increases the supply of oxygen, which results in the fire burning more rapidly.

<br>
-Atmospheric stability is the resistance of the atmosphere to vertical motion.  If the atmosphere is unstable, vertical movement of air is encouraged and this tends to increase fire activity.  If the atmosphere is stable, vertical movement of air is discouraged and this decreases fire activity.  Parcels of air masses with different temperatures are continually mixing trying to reach the same temperature, much as boiling water.  The more difference in the temperatures in the atmosphere, the more unstable the conditions and the more movement--both vertical and horizontally.  More unstable conditions result in more vertical movement in the atmosphere.

<br>
<font size="5" color="white">
-Relative humidity is the term used in prescribed burning to express the amount of moisture in the atmosphere.  It is the ratio of actual water vapor in the atmosphere compared to the amount of water vapor that would saturate the atmosphere at that temperature.  When the relative humidity is 40 percent, it means that the atmosphere contains 40 percent of the moisture that it could contain at that same temperature.
<br><br><br><br>
-The lower the relative humidity, the more readily a fire will start and burn; the more vigorously a fire will burn.  As will be discussed in more detail later, moisture in the fuel absorbs heat and reduces the fires intensity before it is converted to steam and driven off.  When the relative humidity is low, the moisture in the fuel is readily evaporated as it rises to the surface of the fuel.  When the humidity is high, its harder for the moisture to evaporate into the air.  Consequently, high humidity acts like a damper on a stove.  If the humidity is 100 percent or close to it, the fuel will not dry.  On the other hand, the lower the relative humidity, the quicker the moisture will evaporate.

<br>
<font size="5" color="white">
-Precipitation (rain or snow) has a direct and immediate effect on fuel moisture and relative humidity.  Temperature usually drops as well and the winds become calm.  When the atmosphere becomes saturated, precipitation usually occurs if more moisture is added.  Precipitation will quickly dampen the surface of fuels to the point that fires cannot ignite and no wildfires will occur.

</font>
<font size="5" color="white">
<br>
-When moisture is added to the atmosphere or the air temperature is lowered, the relative humidity increases.  When it increases to the saturation point, the moisture begins to combine into droplets.  As this process continues, the droplets become visible--as clouds.  When the atmosphere is very dry, saturation may not be reached, and  no clouds are formed.
<br><br>
<img src="https://windows2universe.org/earth/Atmosphere/images/cloudformation_Fronts_small.jpg"   width="340" height="280" style="float: right">
-Clouds are formed when there is a lot of surface heating from the sun and a lot of moisture is present.  As the air close to the surface is heated, it rises to be replaced by cooler air.  The heated air can rise until it is saturated and clouds form.  As it rises the warmer air cools until it reaches the temperature of the surrounding air.  At this altitude puffy type cumulus clouds will form.  If they continue to build up, they become darker and rain may occur.

<br>
-Wildfires release large amounts of carbon dioxide, black carbon, brown carbon, and ozone precursors into the atmosphere. These emissions affect radiation, clouds, and climate on regional and even global scales.
</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<p>
2-Air Quality:-

<br> -Wildfires also emit substantial amounts of volatile and semi-volatile organic materials and nitrogen oxides that form ozone and organic particulate matter. Direct emissions of toxic pollutants can affect first responders and local residents. In addition, the formation of other pollutants as the air is transported can lead to harmful exposures for populations in regions far away from the wildfires.
<br><br><br>

-Fire suppression practices have led to a buildup of fuels in forests, a breakdown in natural forest ecology, and increased risk at urban-wildland boundaries. As a result, new policies now allow burning where possible.
<br><br>
-fires can directly and indirectly increase carbon emissions to the atmosphere. While they burn, fires release carbon stored in trees or in the soil. In some places like California or Alaska, additional carbon may be released as the dead trees decompose, a process that may take decades because dead trees will stand like ghosts in the forest, decaying slowly.

<br>
-beyond the immediate loss of life and property, smoke is a serious health hazard when small soot particles enter the lungs. Long-term exposure has been linked to higher rates of respiratory and heart problems. 
<br>
</p>
<br><br>
4-On animals :-

<br>
-when wildfire occurs, most animals sense it and can run away or stand in streams to avoid the hazard. Smaller animals take cover in logs, under rocks, or by burying themselves in the dirt. Some animal predators even capitalize on the fire, and have been observed hunting smaller animals who are fleeing the fire.
</p>
<br><br>
<p>
5-Ash and smoke :-
<img src="https://oceana.org/sites/default/files/734564/shutterstock_706065505.jpg"   width="200" height="190" style="float: right">
<br>
-Burning fires produce both ash, which falls to the ground like snow but can also get caught up in winds, and smoke, a mixture of gases and particulate matter. These get into the atmosphere and can travel long distances impacting air quality regionally.

Smoke from wildfires causes air pollution and is bad for your health no matter where you live. Wildfires release harmful pollutants including particulate matter and toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and non-methane organic compounds into the atmosphere. Wildfires can cause displacement, stress and anguish to people who have to flee them, beyond those who suffer direct impacts.</p>
<p>
The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) reported on 23 September 2019 that wild forest and peatland fires across Kalimantan and Sumatra, Indonesia, were putting nearly 10 million children at risk from air pollution. In many countries, escape and protection from air pollution is a privilege not everyone can afford or has equal access to. Air purifiers and good quality pollution masks can be expensive.

Women and girls, especially in developing countries, tend to be more at risk during disasters such as megafires.

Wildfires release carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contribute to global heating when the size of the fire exceeds the CO2 reabsorption potential of re-growth. Wildfires on highly combustible peatland are particularly relevant for climate as they emit far more CO2 than ordinary forest or bush fires. These phenomena are known as climate feedback loops and increase the burden of emissions that must be reduced to limit global temperature increase.

<br>Create an emergency escape plan. Speak to town officials to learn what the evacuation
route is for your area. Discuss this evacuation route with everyone in your family and your
employees. Ensure family members who live nearby know the route and have means of
transportation. Also, stay informed by signing up for emergency text or alert messages from
your town. Finally, don’t forget to create an emergency kit.

<br><font size= "05" font color=" white"> 1. Prepare to evacuate. Listen to emergency channels and know the status of the fire. Put
emergency supplies and must-have items in the car so you can evacuate quickly. Evacuate
immediately if told to do so. If you have time, there are steps you can take to help protect
your property when you evacuate. These steps include: <img src="https://www.redcross.org/content/dam/redcross/about-us/news/stayingsafewildfires.jpg.transform/1288/q70/feature/image.jpeg" width="400" height="320" style="float:right"
<br>1. Moving furniture to the center of rooms and taking down drapes and curtains to prevent
combustion.</br>
<br>2. Closing all windows and doors to prevent drafts and reduce heat.
<br>3. Shutting off natural gas from its source.
<br>4. Turning on all lights in your property so that firefighters can more easily see it through smoke.
 <p><br>• Evacuate Safely. Remain calm while evacuating. If you’re driving, roll up your windows and
close the air vents. The smoke from the fire can get into your car, irritate your eyes and cause
breathing problems. Also, turn your headlights on and keep your doors unlocked. In the event
that something happens to you while driving, locked doors can slow your rescue.<p>
<br><p> <center><font size= "7" font color=" yellow"> After a Wildfire</center></p>
<br><font size= "05" font color=" white"> 1. Return only when it is safe. Do not go back to your property until officials declare it safe to do
so. Watch out for ash pits and hot spots. Even after a fire is extinguished, small fires can flare
up without warning. Check your house and surrounding property for hot spots and extinguish
them immediately. Also, be on the lookout for ash pits. These are holes filled with hot ashes
left by burned trees. Mark ash pits to help prevent others from falling into them and injuring
themselves.<br>

While fire can be a destructive force, it also stimulates growth in the park. Soil receives nutrients from burned plant materials, and when forests burn, more sunlight reaches the ground. Both of these processes help plants to grow. Studying the Yellowstone fires and other fires has provided scientists with evidence that allowing periodic fires, instead of always preventing them, can benefit ecosystems. Periodic fires both prevent the buildup of woody debris that can make fires much larger and stimulates growth in the forest. Over hundreds of years the burned areas will progress through a variety of stages as they recover. This process is called succession.

Wildflowers, grasses, and sagebrush may be the first to grow, but soon aspen trees will begin to sprout. Aspen has a thin bark and burns readily in a fire. But while the part of the tree aboveground is damaged or destroyed, the extensive underground network of roots is protected from the heat of the flames by the soil, so it isn’t long after the fire is out before shoots begin to grow. Unlike the aspen, Douglas fir trees have very thick bark that insulates most of the tree from the heat. Such trees are very resilient and can often survive fires. Lodgepole pine, which makes up 80% of the forests of Yellowstone, has thin bark and the trees burn readily in fires, but it also benefits from fire. This tree produces cones that are glued shut by resin. Only the heat of a fire is enough to melt the resin and allow the cone to open for the seeds inside to disperse. Since the seeds will be produced after the ground has been cleared and enriched by fire, they are more likely to grow. Scientists found that 345 elk died as a direct result of the fires, which is less than 1% of the elk population.

<p>During the winter following the fire, thousands of elk died from lack of food, but the numbers of elk had recovered completely within five years. The fires also killed some fish, 36 deer, 12 moose, 6 black bears, 9 bison, and possibly 1 grizzly bear. The carcasses of these animals provided food for other animals, such as coyotes, bears, and some birds. Dead trees provided more places for birds like woodpeckers and bluebirds to find holes in which to build their nests. Overall there does not seem to have been a significant long-term negative effect on animal populations. The fires did have an effect on tourism while they were occurring, but the influx of firefighters and the media made up for this to some degree. There was no decrease in the number of tourists who visited the region the following year.
